This is an analysis and visualization of current market data to uncover insights that can help job seekers and employers better understand employment trends.

This project is split into two parts: the **Job Scraper** and the **Data Analysis** _(this project)_ using the data scraped from the first part.

# Part II - Data Analysis

This part involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and some feature extractions using the data that was scraped from Part I.

All the details about the part can be found in `analysis.ipynb`.

All the data that have been "processed" are stored under `transformed/` the directory.
